# Moments-Based Regularized LBM with Curved Boundary Conditions

This repository contains the implementation for a **Moments-Based Regularized Lattice Boltzmann Method (MRLBM)** featuring a novel **curved boundary treatment** for accurate and efficient simulation of flows past complex geometries on Cartesian grids.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

We develop a robust curved boundary condition for the 2D MRLBM, combining the computational efficiency of uniform Cartesian grids with accurate curved-boundary representation through **moment regularization** and **extrapolation**.

### Key Features:
- **Memory-Efficient MRLBM**: Stores macroscopic moments instead of full distribution functions, reducing memory usage by **33% (2D)** compared to conventional LBM.
- **Novel Curved Boundary Treatment**: Implements two methods:
  - **Method A**: Cartesian coordinate approach.
  - **Method B (Recommended)**: Rotated coordinate system aligned with boundary normals for enhanced stability.
- **Extrapolation-Based Technique**: Uses quadratic extrapolation to impose wall conditions accurately on stair-case approximated surfaces.
- **GPU-Accelerated**: Highly parallelizable implementation demonstrating significant speedup.

## ðŸ“‹ Methodology Summary

### Governing Equations
The core evolution of the particle distribution function is split into:
1.  **Collision**: Performed in moments space using a BGK operator.
    ```math
    \rho^* m^{*(2)}_{\alpha\beta} = (1-\omega \Delta t) \rho m^{(2)}_{\alpha\beta} + \omega \Delta t \rho u_\alpha u_\beta
    ```
2.  **Regularization**: Filters non-hydrodynamic modes from the distribution function.
    ```math
    f^*_i = \rho w_i \left( 1+ a_s^{-2} u_\alpha c_{i\alpha} + \frac{1}{2} a_s^{-4} m^{*(2)}_{\alpha\beta} H^{(2)}_{\alpha\beta,i} \right)
    ```
3.  **Streaming**: Propagates regularized distributions to neighboring nodes.
    ```math
    f_i(\bm{x}+\mathbf{c}_i \Delta t, t+\Delta t) = f^{*}_i(\bm{x}, t)
    ```

### Curved Boundary Treatment (Method B)
For curved boundaries, the algorithm:
1.  Classifies nodes into **Fluid**, **Boundary**, and **Solid**.
2.  At boundary nodes, macroscopic variables are determined via **quadratic extrapolation** along the wall-normal direction.
3.  Uses a **local rotated coordinate system** `(x', y')` aligned with the boundary normal/tangential directions.
4.  Enforces boundary conditions by solving a system formed by the strong form of mass conservation and second-order moment constraints in this local frame.
